        <li>
          The application operates by managing multiple files, each designated
          for specific recipients.
        </li>
        <li>
          You need to send each file to its designated recipient with the same
          subject and body for every email.
        </li>
        <li>
          For instance, a salary sheet or slip intended for a specific customer
          will have the same subject and body for all emails.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have 20 employees and need to send each of them a salary slip,
          you can send all the emails with a single click.
        </li>
        <li>
          You must provide your SMTP settings, though these settings will not be
          saved.
        </li>
        <li>
          The file name should match the recipient's email address. For example,
          if the attachment is a PDF, the file name should be in the format
          name@email.com.pdf.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a file with an invalid email address is found, the application will
          generate an error for that specific file.
        </li>
        <li>
          All emails before the invalid file name will be sent and deleted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Emails from the file with the invalid email format onward will not be
          sent until you delete the file with the incorrect email format.
        </li>
        <li>
          When an email is successfully sent, the associated file will be
          deleted.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can manually delete all files or delete them one by one if there
          are any errors related to email sending.
        </li>
      </ul>
